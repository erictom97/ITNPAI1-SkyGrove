Tree detection in images is an important task in various applications, such as forest management, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Object detection is an extension of Image classification task. We not only assign a label to the image but also localize the object in the image by drawing a bounding box around it.

Object detection models, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, have shown great success. Faster R-CNN is a region-based object detection model that uses a two-stage approach to detect objects, while YOLO is a single-stage object detection model that directly predicts object bounding boxes and class probabilities from the image. In this research, we compare the performance of Faster R-CNN with different backbones and YOLO for tree detection. We evaluate the models on a dataset of labelled images containing trees and also through the test dataset from other city. Our experiments' results provide insights into strengths and weaknesses of our models and can help guide the selection of the best model for this application.
